### DETERMINING PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE

## Applying Quantitative Techniques using Python and Pandas

I'm comparing portfolio performance across the following areas:
* Volatility
* returns
* risk
* sharpe ratio

In use analysis notebook that analyses and visualises the major metrics of portfolios across all of the above mentioned areas and determined which portfolio outperformed the others.
I use historical daily returns of several portfolios including:
* Algorithmic portfolio
* Whale investors
* S&P TSX60 index
I also include my own custom portfolio for comparison.

For comparison I read the data from the csv files and clean it by removing all nulls, indexing and remaning columns as required.

# Thenin the data into a single dataframe and go ahead to perform a quantitative analysis by:

* calculating a plotting daily return of all portfolios
* Calculating cumulative returns for all portfolios and determing if any outperforms the S&P TSX60
